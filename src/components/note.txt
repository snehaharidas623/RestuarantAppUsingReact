REDUX
-----
coupling - parent child relations.here child are dependend on parent.so an issue to a child cause error in entire project.

-props drilling
  if any intermediate component have errors then all other childs will not work

-To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components indipendent.

-For this react introduce the technology -state management technology called REDUX
 
 redux process
 -------------
 *create a new js file to keep the states,all the component can acess the js file

 *The components only can access the datas from js file,but cant update the datas in js file

 *Action - a file contain all logic to update state

 *Dispatch - method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need updation

 *Reducer - update datas in js file acording to payload response get from action file

 LIBRARIES FOR APPLY REDUX
 -------------------------
 REDUX
 REACT-REDUX
 REdux-THUNK
  eg- npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

  createStore()- method used to create store in js file
                2 arguments used. 
                   1)Reducer
                   2)middleware - redux is syncronous. so to make it as asyncrons we use middleware
applyMiddleware() - method in redux to apply middleware          
combineReducers() - method in redux to combine all reducers in js file   
thunk  in REDUX-THUNK -used to create middleware      

1.create store
2.apply store in index.js by provider tag

AXIOS
------
Module used to make http methods(api calls)
  - npm i axios


UseDispatch - hook 
-----------------
used to dispatch actions in components - from react-redux  

To acess data from store to different components we need hook
  -called useSelector
